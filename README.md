# A small game

This is a small game that is adapted from my classwork for Lambda School's Javascript III during the Fundamentals of Javascript sprint.

## Current State

At the moment you are able to choose whether you are playing as a Hero or a Villain, and you have two options available to you during gameplay: Attack your opponent or Heal yourself.

## Future Plans

* [ ] Expand the opponent options and randomize which you are confronted by at start.

* [ ] Add the ability to choose a weapon from a list of possibilities when confronted.

* [ ] Add levels.

* [ ] Add types of attacks.
